## Vigilancia
Hi, Vigilancia is a video surveiilance software which takes advantage of recent advances in computer vision and deep learning to provide an assistive automated surveillance tech. It uses veriety of deep networks to perform various visual surveillance activities and raises alerts whenever it detects an anomaly.

Vigilancia was developed by me and my team mates as final year project in our University. The code is opensource and anyone who would like to improve upon our work is invited to do so.
